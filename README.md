WiFi Enabled USB Rubber Ducky 
WiFi Enabled USB Rubber Ducky for under $20

An Arduino and ESP8266 based USB Rubber Ducky fashioned on the HAK5 Rubber Ducky Module. Since the keystrokes are sent over WiFi, no microSD card is needed.

This device allows keystrokes to be sent via WiFi to a target machine. The target recognises the Ducky as both a standard HID keyboard and a serial port, allows interactive commands and scripts to be executed on the target remotely.

The software can be used via the Cactus Micro v2 Arduino Board, or theres a version for an Arduino connected to a ESP-12E module for those who wish to build thier own hardware.

The WiDucky is controlled via the 'controller' application. There are Python, Windows and Ardroid examples to choose from in the controllers folder. So the device is compatiable with Linux/Windows/MAC/Android attacker machine. (Yes - You can use an Android phone as the attacker!)
